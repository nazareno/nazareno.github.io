I'm a Professor at the Computer Science Department of Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), in Brazil. This is an amazing position where I have the opportunity to:

## Teach

Data Science, [Data Visualization](https://nazareno.github.io/vis-ppgcc/), Software Development, and [Research Methods](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvvIUEwTZK9wvSEiASWyLXYb2a2KAON-v) to Computer Science grad and undergrad students.

I've previously taught Software Design, Numerical Methods, Social Computing and Art & Tech to CS students, and Art & Technology and [Data Visualization to journalists](https://escoladedados.org/coda2020/workshop-storytelling-com-dados-estruturas-tecnicas-e-mao-na-massa-com-flourish/), artists, and architects.

## Do research

I've studied mostly Data Visualization, Music Information Retrieval, Data Science, Civic Tech, and Social Computing. The best list of publication is [on google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=c0T-mjUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

I strive to cultivate three characteristics in research: kindness, aversion for Discipline boundaries (interdisciplinary work is best), and curiosity for methods from different fields.

## Lead Lab Analytics

The lab is a Civic Data Science group at UFCG that develops some amazing R&D projects and has developed a lot of technology currently in production.

## Supervise MSc and Ph.D. students

I've the privilege to work with and learn from some very talented people.

## And more

I'm also [active in the Brazilian hacktivism community](https://speakerdeck.com/nazareno/dados-abertos-para-fazer-o-que-o-estado-nao-faria), and I tend to maintain numerous personal projects [on the intersection of computing, art and politics](https://speakerdeck.com/nazareno/ciencia-de-dados-politica-arte). You can also find me [on GitHub](https://github.com/nazareno) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zananeno).
