A network of jazz artists from Discogs data connected if they've recorded with the same bass players. Not meant to be readable, just fun. And because I play the bass.

For the brave, there is [an interactive network created with the Smithsonian recordings](https://nazareno.github.io/folkmusicmap/folks-network.html) from around the globe. Excerpts are connected by similarity. Colors represent countries. If you click on a node, you'll hear the recording. I find it fun to look for similarity between music from very different cultures.
