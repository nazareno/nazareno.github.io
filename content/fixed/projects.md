I coordinate since 2012 the Lab Analytics, a Civic Data Science group I co-founded at UFCG. The lab usually has 20-30 researchers and software engineers and developed projects funded by Hewlett Packard, government agencies, startups, and NGOs. Some recent projects:

* [Parlametria](http://parlametria.org.br/)  is a platform that uses Data Science and Machine Learning to inform advocacy actions of a network of 100+ NGOs. Developed with Dado Capital, Kunumi and UFMG.

* [Tá de Pé](https://tadepemerenda.transparencia.org.br/)  is a platform for citizens to analyze governmental purchases of meals for public schools and goods to fight the pandemic in Brazil. Developed with Transparência Brasil.

* [DadosjusBr](https://www.dadosjusbr.org) opens spending data from the Brazilian judiciary system. This data is published in pdf, xls and other formats, and we are creating an open normalized and easy to use platform to expose the current situation and motivate change. Developed with MPPB and Transparência Brasil.

* **Monitor Cidadão** was developed with Campinatec, a local startup, and uses predictive analytics to guide citizen attention to specific projects in a different state (PB).

* [Olho N’Água](http://olhonagua.insa.gov.br/)  helps citizen follow the state of water reservoirs in the Brazilian semiarid countryside. Developed with [INSA](http://insa.gov.br/).

* [Datapedia Eleições](https://eleicoes.datapedia.info) explores electoral results from the last 20 years in Brazil. Developed with Datapedia.

* The design and development of a **secure and auditable lottery system and protocol** that was used for the distribution of 4,000 houses by the Brazilian Government.  

<!-- * I have led the programming and writing of in-depth data analysis reports. Three of such reports are:  [one about campaign donations](https://parlametria.org.br/relatorios/2019/11/setores-economicos-na-campanha-2018)  received by current members of the Brazilian Congress,  [one about the relationship between Congress members and the Amazon](https://analytics-ufcg.github.io/global-witness/perfil-parlamentares-gw-v2.html) , and  [one about patterns in calls to a support line for Cancer patients](https://nazareno.github.io/oncoguia/) . -->

* [Contribua.org](http://www.contribua.org/)  is a crowdsourcing/citizen-science platform based on PyBossa.
