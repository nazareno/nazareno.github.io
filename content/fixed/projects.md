I coordinate since 2012 the Lab Analytics, a Civic Data Science group I co-founded at UFCG. The lab usually has 20-30 researchers and software engineers and developed projects funded by Hewlett Packard, government agencies, startups, and NGOs. Some recent projects:

<br/>

## Parlametria
<sub>[[site](http://painel.parlametria.org.br/)][[code](http://github.com/parlametria/)][[reports](https://parlametria.org.br/relatorios)]</sub>

Platform to detect and predict activity patterns in law bills and congressmen work. It's in use since 2019 by 80+ NGOs that monitor the Brazilian Congress.

Parlametria uses statistical modeling, NLP (word embeddings, lexicons), and deep learning to help. Developed with Dado Capital, Kunumi and UFMG.
